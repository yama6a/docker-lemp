          # in our Docker image aren't in the shared volume. We need to

          # to this volume from our Docker image the files wouldn't appear
          # in the nginx container.
          #
          # So, after the container has started, copy the PHP files from this
          # container's local filesystem (/code -- added via the Docker image)
          # to the shared volume, which is mounted at /var/www/html.
